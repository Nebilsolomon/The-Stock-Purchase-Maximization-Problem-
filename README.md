# The-Stock-Purchase-Maximization-Problem-
n this project, you will design, implement and analyze an exhaustive optimization and a 
dynamic programming algorithm for solving the same problem.   
 
The Stock Purchase Maximization Problem 
Given a fixed amount of purchasing power or financial resources, the problem seeks to maximize 
the number of stocks an investor may purchase. Future values of these stocks are not considered 
at the time of purchase. 
 
This problem can be mathematically represented as: 
 
Stock purchase maximation problem 
input: a set of items numbered 1 to 𝑛, each having a number of stocks 𝑠!  and a value 𝑣!,  n= 
(𝑠,𝑣). 𝑀 is  the total available investment sum. 
 
output: a list of items P from 𝑛, such that the total number of stocks in P is maximized, and the 
total value of all items in P is at most M.

Assume that you are given a set of stocks as an array of arrays. Each entry in the subarray 
represents a company, with the number of stocks available and the cumulative value of all available 
stocks. You are also given a specific sum of money to invest.  Buying a fraction of any item is not 
allowed. Your task is to design an algorithm to determine the maximum number of stocks you are 
able to purchase. Your solution should give the indices of the array(stocks) to be selected. The 
cumulative value of all selected stocks must be equal or less than the given sum.  The problem is 
similar to a well-known algorithmic optimization problem. 
 
A sample is given below. It contains 4 items corresponding to company A, B, C and D. Each 
company has [𝑥,𝑦] attributes, where 𝑥 = numbers of trading stocks  and 𝑦  = monetary value of 
the trading stocks.  
 
Sample input 
Stocks_and_values = [ [1, 2], [3, 3], [5, 6], [6, 7] ]. 
Amount = 10 
 
Sample Output = [10, [1,3] 
where 1 is the index of [3, 3] and 3 is the index of [6, 7] 
 
 
The Exhaustive Search Approach (Part A) 
An exhaustive search algorithm can be used to solve this problem. The approach evaluates the 
number of stocks and values of all possible subsets, and selects the subset with the highest value 
that is still under the available fund limit. It recomputes combination at each state. This approach 
provides an efficient, but expensive solution. 
def stock_maximization (M, items): 
       best = None 
       for candidates in <stocks_combinations>(items): 
            if verify_combinations(M, items, candidate): 
                  if best is None or total_value(candidate) > total_value(best) 
                        best = candidate 
        return best 
This approach was extensively discussed in class.  
 
The Dynamic Programming  Approach (Part B) 
This problem can also be solved using the dynamic programming approach.  It uses a top-down 
dynamic programming to handle the overlapping subproblems. Since there are two changing 
values, the resultant amount and the current index, a two-dimensional array can be used to store 
the results of all the solved sub-problems.  
To calculate the maximum value obtainable with the selection of item 𝑖, a comparison of its cost 
is made with  the total purchase capacity. If item 𝑖 cost more than the available investment sum, it 
cannot be used. If a new candidate potentially increases the value of purchase and is less or equal 
to the maximum available sum, it is selected. The approach evaluates the highest value of all 
possible subsets, then selects the subset with the highest value that is still under the weight limit.
